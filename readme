Project Report: Branch Profitability Analysis
1. Introduction

This project analyzes the performance and profitability of bank branches. It uses financial and operational data to identify high-performing vs. underperforming branches, applying statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques. The insights can be used by management to optimize operations, improve profitability, and make data-driven decisions.

2. Objectives & Aims

Objective: Evaluate branch profitability and uncover factors driving revenue performance.

Aim:

Benchmark branch performance.

Detect underperforming branches and their causes.

Use predictive models to estimate branch profitability.

Provide visual insights into geographical and operational trends.

3. Methodology
Step 1: Data Preprocessing

Imported branch financial dataset (branch_task.csv).

Checked missing values, outliers, and unique entries.

Applied scaling & encoding for categorical features.

Outlier detection using Isolation Forest and Box-Cox Transformation.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate & bivariate analysis with Seaborn & Matplotlib.

Visualized distribution of revenue, profit, expenses across branches.

Correlation analysis to check relationships between financial metrics.

Step 3: Data Visualization

Bar charts → Revenue & Profit per branch.

Heatmaps → Correlation between financial features.

Boxplots → Outlier detection in revenue & expenses.

Geographical Maps (Folium) → Branch performance on interactive maps.

Clustering (KMeans + PCA) → Grouped branches by profitability & performance.

Step 4: Predictive Modeling

Models applied:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Neural Network (MLP Regressor)

Metrics used:

R² Score (goodness of fit)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Step 5: Model Evaluation

Compared models on predictive accuracy.

Random Forest Regressor performed best with the highest R² and lowest error.

4. Technical Skills Demonstrated

Programming & Libraries:

Python (core language).

Pandas, NumPy → Data handling & preprocessing.

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization.

Folium → Interactive map visualization.

Scikit-learn → ML models, PCA, clustering, model evaluation.

Machine Learning Techniques:

Regression (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR, Neural Network).

Dimensionality reduction (PCA).

Clustering (KMeans).

Outlier detection (Isolation Forest).

Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).

Analytical Skills:

Correlation & trend analysis.

Profitability benchmarking.

Identifying operational inefficiencies.

5. Data Visualization & Insights

Bar Charts – Compare revenue, profit, and expenses across branches.

Boxplots – Identify outliers in financial performance.

Heatmaps – Highlight correlations (e.g., revenue ↔ expenses, profit ↔ revenue).

Cluster Plots (PCA + KMeans) – Classify branches into High, Medium, Low performers.

Geographical Maps (Folium) – Show branch performance on interactive city maps.

6. Results

Identified top-performing branches with consistently high revenue & profit.

Highlighted underperforming branches due to high expenses or low revenue.

Built predictive model (Random Forest) to forecast profitability.

Cluster analysis showed clear segmentation of branches by performance levels.

Outlier branches flagged for management review.

7. Business Use Cases

Branch Managers: Compare profitability against peers.

Executives: Decide where to allocate resources.

Finance Teams: Monitor trends in revenue/expenses.

Strategic Planning: Optimize underperforming locations.

8. Conclusion

The project successfully combines data preprocessing, machine learning, and advanced visualization to evaluate branch performance.
Key findings include:

Revenue strongly drives profitability, but expenses significantly reduce margins.

Random Forest Regressor proved most reliable in predicting profitability.

Branch clusters and geographical maps provide actionable insights for decision-making.
